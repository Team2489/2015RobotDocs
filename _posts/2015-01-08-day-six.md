### Grabber

Today we further narrowed down how to design the grabber. And the narrowing-down
process brought us to agree to try them all. That may not seem like narrowing
down, but we predict building basic prototypes will not take long (hopefully at
most a meeting, though this depends on tool availability). From there we can
have a better idea of what works and what doesn't.

Overall, our goal is to make a grabber with the ability to lift both totes and
containers. This may very well turn out to be a combination of a few options we
considered. Hence testing them all.

Attached are pictures of our white board progress.
