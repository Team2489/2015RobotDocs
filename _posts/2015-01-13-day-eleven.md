excerpt: The programming and electronics team experimented with basic programs to run on the tester bot. the new programmers tried to drive the robot with two joysticks rather than the one joystick template program. the team attempted to install opencv -- the vision detection library -- but installation failed due to issues with the library's code. the assembly embedded in the code did not run properly. By Friday, we should have vision software running.

### Programming / Electronics

The programming and electronics team experimented with basic programs to run on
the tester bot. the new programmers tried to drive the robot with two joysticks
rather than the one joystick template program. the team attempted to install
opencv -- the vision detection library -- but installation failed due to issues
with the library's code. the assembly embedded in the code did not run properly.
by friday, we should have vision software running.

### Chassis

The chassis subteam finalized a mecanum drivetrain today. We plan to order the
parts from Andymark later today. If we powdercoat the robot, it will be done
during Finals while there are not meetings. The parts from Andymark will arrive
at the end of the Week 3, so we can collect the chassis from RMS Rolling and
Coating and immediately put together the mecanum drivetrain. The total cost for
both robots (for mecanum change) comes to $1630.

### Elevator

The elevator subteam continue to assemble the prototype frame using the parts
cut yesterday. The zeroeth stage was placed onto wood, but we ran out wood.
Additionally, the team used angle stock and old rollers to create a primitive
sliding mechanism for testing. Tasks left include:

* Complete first stage frame (Need 2" by 2" wood)
* Add more rollers for sliding (Need sliding rollers)
* Mount pulleys (need mounted pulleys)
* Mount winch and cord, test.

The elevator prototype should be done by Sunday.

Additionally, we began with some motor calculations for both picking up 4 totes
at once and 1 tote at a time. See the calculations below for more detail.
