## Day 16

Today, the elevator and claw sub-teams continued to work on the elevator
prototype that was put together yesterday. The claw was lowered so that is able
to lift a tote from its initial position. We also strengthened the claw by
adding more contact points. This allowed it to lift two totes. We also created a
list of pros and cons between the single hook claw and the grabber that wraps
around the box.


### Programming / Electronics


The programming/electronics team continued to work on the electronics board.
