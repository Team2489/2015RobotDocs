Today, the team split into subgroups: manipulation and electronics. The
manipulator group discussed design goals and strategies regarding the number of
totes we can lift, claw designs to grab the totes and containers, and efficient
ways to accomplish this. Electronics created a list of parts the team needed to
order and materials that need to be brought from the storage.
