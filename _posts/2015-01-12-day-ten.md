excerpt: Today, the team moved back the majority of our team equipment and supplies from Saurabh's garage to the Playspace. We unpacked and organized our boxes of materials afterwards. As we may be moving into another building soon, we may need to move again, but hopefully we will be permanantly settled down by the end of this week.

Today, the team moved back the majority of our team equipment and supplies from
Saurabh's garage to the Playspace. We unpacked and organized our boxes of
materials afterwards. As we may be moving into another building soon, we may
need to move again, but hopefully we will be permanantly settled down by the end
of this week.

### Elevator Prototype

Currently, we are simultaenously CADing an elevator design and making a
prototype to test proof of concept. By the end of this week, we want to be ready
to proceed with the final CAD of the elevator. Today, the elevator subteam cut
the wood for the base of the elevator prototype. Tomorrow, we need to continue
assembling the frame (will need more wood) and attach rollers. At the same time,
we will be working on motor speed calculations and picking a motor/gearbox
combination.

### Programming and Electronics

The electronics and programming team completed their test robot today. The robot
has last year's chassis with the all-new drive control system completely wired
up and prepared for testing. By the end of the meeting, the robot was even able
to drive around the floor. Hopefully, this will give our drivers plenty of
practice and make actually implementing electronics much smoother / cleaner.
