excerpt: The chassis skid-steer wheels were assembled, and we decided on a mecanum drivetrain. The elevator and superstructure team compiled a parts list for the prototype, finished a CAD of the superstructure, the elevator stage, and the rollers on the KOP chassis. The programming/electronics subteam finished wiring Stitch completely, and connected the talons to the robot. We also debated on whether or not to buy pizza, and in the end, did not buy any.

### Chassis 

The chassis team finished assembling skid-steer style wheels. All the pieces for
the square orientation were cut. We decided on a mecanum drivetrain, so we plan
to buy the four inch mecanum kit when it is released on Andymark.

### Elevator and Superstructure

Today, we began design of the superstructure and elevator. We have decided to go
with a continuous elevator design, with a second stage of 30 inches. The second
stage will be in line with the superstructure and ride on rollers, which we can
purchase from the below website.

We will need to order about 16 of the rollers. We finished a CAD of the
superstructure, the elevator stage, and the rollers on top of the KOP chassis.
We still need to place the pulleys in the appropriate configuration and create a
testable prototype.

***Parts Needed***

* Light 2" by 2" wood (a lot)
* Angle stock
* Smooth rollers (Home Depot / Lowes)
* Pulleys
* Strong cord
* Winch
* Motor to drive

CAD will be completed within the next couple of days. Currently, we plan to
prototype for all of this week, and hopefully finalize the CAD at the end of
this week based on prototyping results.

### Programming / Electronics

The programming team finished assembling Stitch with the Talons and the new
control system. They are currently working on connecting to the laptop.

We also considered buying pizza, and quickly made the following graph to judge
how much pizza to buy. After realizing it was almost 12, though, we decided not
to buy pizza.
