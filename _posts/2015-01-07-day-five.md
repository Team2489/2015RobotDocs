Today, we split into subgroups and discussed our varying prototypes.

### Business

At today's business meeting, we discussed awards. We completed the essay for the
Woodie Flowers award and started to work on the Entrepreneurship award. We also
discussed ideas for the Chairman's Award video.

We also discussed finance. To get more sponsors, we talked about a strategy
called "100 for 100". It basically involves asking numerous companies for small
amounts of money. This will require volunteers from the team. Essentially, we
plan to compose a list of 100 companies, and ask each for $100. Because the
amount is so small, companies may be willing to and we should make a substantial
amount of money.

We're also looking at a potential room with ThermoFisher. They have agreed, but
we're working out the logistics at the moment.

### Chassis

We began by weighing the pros and cons of each chassis type. Wide was out of the
question, but we looked at long and square.

Based on these results, we decided to go with a square chassis. We then moved on
to discuss wheels. Currently, our team is looking at either mecanum or skid-
steer driving. Although mecanum would be more appropriate for this game, skid-
steer is simpler, and we have more experience. The current members of the team
have never made a mecanum before and have limited experience with the drive
type. We would also lose time that could be better spent on manipulators. With
that in mind, we will be using a skid-steer style drivetrain.

## Elevator

The elevator subgroup began by deciding on a continuous elevator, as it is
fairly simple compared to a cascading elevator. We made a list of parts that we
would need, and began discussing ways to get the elevator to slide. We also
discussed potential heights. For the moment, we will be prototyping two 3 foot
stage elevators, for a total just under six feet. The main concern with an
elevator is the center of gravity -- with each box weighing 8 lbs, we will
significantly shift our center of gravity if we build the elevator to one side.
Additionally, the number of totes that we stack will impact the height of the
elevator. For instance:
* Four totes and one recycle bin: 77 inches
* Three totes and one recycle bin: 65 inches

For prototyping, though, we will just go with two three foot lengths, since that
will give us plenty of room.

The idea of bottom loading versus top loading was brought up again with regards
to speed. Because this leaves both options open, we can continue prototyping and
make a specific decision later.

We have the options of using linear slides or rollers to get the elevator to
move smoothly; we need to decide this and send out a prototyping parts list
within the next couple of days.

### Claw

Ideas were tossed around about how exactly the robot should pick up
totes/containers. We discussed picking up the totes on the long side vs. the
short side, picking it up with two arms along the side vs. one hook in front,
and how to design a hook that grabs both totes and containers in one elegant
mechanism. Here's a list of brainstorms:

* (Two side arms) Have those wheels like on the bottom of the screen doors so it
self-aligns
* (Two side arms) one arm fixed, one on a piston that closes on the tote
* (One front hook) Use the grooves on the face of the tote to guide the hook
into the hole
* (One front hook) Funnel it in with diagonal arms. Don't need to be long arms,
just long enough to align box. Could have the screen door wheels
* (Curved hook) Picks it up from the front, but the body of the claw is curved
to wrap around a recycle container. The two endpoints of the curve are flat to
pick up the totes

## Quote of the Day

Finally, quote of the day goes to Jordy.
