After a three day hiatus due to finals, we continued building our prototypes.

### Elevator

The elevator sub-team worked on strengthening the double claw prototype that was
previously attached to the elevator.

### Claw

Today, the claw sub-team started to construct an active claw prototype that uses
a piston. But it was not stable due to the weight of the wood. The active claw
will be secured and completed by next meeting.

### Programming / Electronics

The electronics/programming sub-team worked on making a case for the Jetson and
a bit on the tester board. They also downloaded a test program for the Jetson.
