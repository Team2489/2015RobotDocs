excerpt: Today, the elevator sub-team added the second set of rollers allowing the prototype to function properly. The tote grabber was later attached to the elevator which was able to carry a tote up the elevator. It can only lift one tote for now because the wood is too weak to carry more. An actual aluminum version, however, should be strong enough to successfully carry a package.

## Day 13

### Elevator

Today, the elevator sub-team added the second set of rollers allowing the
prototype to function properly. The tote grabber was later attached to the
elevator which was able to carry a tote up the elevator. It can only lift one
tote for now because the wood is too weak to carry more. An actual aluminum
version, however, should be strong enough to successfully carry a package.

### Claw

The claw team assembled the "single hook" claw in an active system, with the
claw actuated by a piston. This should help us decide the "Active versus Passive
debate." Currently, we are looking more towards a passive design because of the
simplicity; given the time we have left and our resources, it may not be
possible to create an active grabber.

### Electronics / Programming

The programming/electronics sub-team started building an electronics board to
test PID for Jaguars and Talons. We will be using the "old" Talons for this
year, as they are still very functional and fairly small.
