### Chassis

The chassis sub-team made gearboxes and fixed the wheels. When more tools are
moved from the storage into the Play Space, the team will be able to continue
with the chassis.

### Grabber

The manipulation sub-team finalized the dimensions for the claw prototype and
made the sidehooks. They will be cutting wood tomorrow for prototyping. They had
also cut pieces for the grabber prototype.

### Programming / Electronics

The electronics/programming sub-team finished attaching the basic electronics
onto the robot and turned it on. The LED's on the RoboRio and other components
lit up. The team also started on attaching the Talons to the robot. Tomorrow,
they will finish attaching the Talons and drive the robot. If time allows, they
will try uploading and testing some basic programs.
