###This is working

Today, the grabber/claw sub-team built a claw prototype that supports bottom
load tote lifting. The length of the claw was shortened to save space. The team
also discussed ideas about a more secure method to grab the totes using rubber
and/or polycarb hooks. Because of the way autonomous is structured, we
definitely want to be able to lift from the wide side. With that in mind, the
next major decision is a passive versus active grabber design.
